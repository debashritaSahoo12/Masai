          <h2>Client & Server communication.</h2>
          <p>
            In an Operating System, Client Server Communication refers to the
            exchange of data and Services among multiple machines or processes.
            In Client client-server communication System one process or machine
            acts as a client requesting a service or data, and Another machine
            or process acts like a server for providing those Services or Data
            to the client machine. This Communication model is widely used for
            exchanging data among various computing environments like
            <b
              >Distributed Systems, Internet Applications, and Networking
              Application communication</b
            >. The communication between Server and Client takes place with
            different Protocols and mechanisms.

          <h3>The Journey of a Web Request</h3>
          <h5><i>from browser to server</i></h5>
          <p>
            In the vast expanse of the internet, every click, every search, and
            every interaction we make through our browsers initiates a journey —
            a complex journey that spans across various technologies, protocols,
            and infrastructures before arriving at its destination and back.
            This article is a deep dive into the odyssey of a web request from
            the moment you hit enter on your browser to when it reaches the
            systems and returns with the information or service you sought. Grab
            your digital explorer gear, we’re tracing the path of a web request
            using debuggers and dissecting the components it encounters along
            the way.

              Web requests are essential to how the World Wide Web works, as
              they enable clients to retrieve and display web content from
              servers worldwide. Web requests are typically made using HTTP, but
              other protocols, such as HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol
              Secure), can also be used for more secure communications.

          <h3>Steps of how a web request works</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Use GeoIP or some similar database or service which maps IPs to
              physical locations
            </li>
            <li>
              Use the W3C geolocation api (supported by newer browsers only)
            </li>
            <li>Google gears geolocation</li>

          <ul>
            <li>DNS Request:</li>
            <p>
              When you type https://www.google.com into your browser, the first
              step is to translate the human-readable domain name
              (www.google.com) into an IP address. This translation is performed
              by the Domain Name System (DNS). Your computer sends a DNS request
              to a DNS server, which then resolves the domain name to the
              corresponding IP address (such as 172.217.3.196 for Google).
            </p>
            <li>TCP/IP</li>
            <p>
              Once the IP address is obtained, your computer establishes a
              connection to the destination server using the Transmission
              Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP). TCP ensures
              reliable communication by breaking data into packets and
              reassembling them at the destination, while IP handles routing and
              addressing.
            </p>
            <li>HTTPS/SSL:</li>
            <p>
              If the destination server supports HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer
              Protocol Secure), your browser initiates a secure connection using
              SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security)
              encryption. This ensures that the data transmitted between your
              browser and the server is encrypted and cannot be intercepted by
              third parties.
